In order to solve problem during webstart deployment on Linux, you have to configure your security policy of your local jvm

On Ubuntu, you have to edit the file:
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/security/java.policy

And add the following lines to the section "default permissions granted to all domains"

grant {
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "nonBatchMode", "read";
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "useJavaUtilZip", "read";
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "checkZipIndexTimestamp", "read";
};
