<h1>The Dutch Flag Problem</h1>

<p>This problem was first proposed by E.W Dijkstra in 1976 (in the chapter 14
of his book "A Discipline of Programming").  It is a very classical
variation of the sorting algorithms since then. It is sometimes useful in
real life, but it became famous for its pedagogical properties: its
complexity is not trivial, but not complex either.  It can easily be
formally proven, but it's not absolutely trivial either. </p>  

<h3>O que eu posso fazer para melhorar este universo do PLM?</h3>

<p>Como sempre, existem várias coisas que podem ser feitas no código deste
universo para melhorá-lo:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A temporal view could be welcomed.</li>
  <li>Other exercises, for example with 2 colors only or with more than 3 colors,
could generalize the proposed approach.</li>
  <li>This problem could be solved recursively.</li>
</ul>
