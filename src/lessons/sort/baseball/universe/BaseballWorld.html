<h1>Rainbow Baseball</h1>
<p>The colors are represented by integers, between <code>0</code> and <code>amount of bases -1</code>. 
The hole is represented by the special value <code>-1</code>. 
The color of each base is its rank. So base <code>1</code> is of color <code>1</code>. 
In the graphical interface, the base <code>0</code> is the dark blue
one while the base <code>1</code> is the fuscia one.</p>

<p>Once every players on the field are in their home base, the hole should be in the last base, that is of rank <code>getAmountOfBases()-1</code>.</p>
