<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

This lesson allows to experiment with some classical sorting algorithms (and
some less common variant of them). The goal is two fold: you can first
better understand the idea of these algorithms by writing them yourself. But
even if you don't code the algorithms, you can use the demo mode to organize
"races" between these algorithms to experiment in practice what the
different asymptotical complexity mean. 

<p>More exercises are planned for the future, on recursive sorting algorithms
(such as QuickSort and MergeSort) or using other microworlds to apply these
algorithms to other contexts.</p>

<h3>O que eu posso fazer para melhorar este universo do PLM?</h3>

<p>Como sempre, existem várias coisas que podem ser feitas no código deste
universo para melhorá-lo:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other graphical representations could be proposed, such as the ones
presented at <a href="http://sorting.at/">http://sorting.at/</a>.</li>
</ul>
