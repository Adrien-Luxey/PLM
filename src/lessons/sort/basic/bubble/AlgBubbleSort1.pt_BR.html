<h1>BubbleSort</h1>

<p>Welcome to the sorting universe. It allows you to experiment with the
existing sorting algorithms. The list of buildins that you can use in your
algorithms is available in the world reference documentation
("Help"-&gt;"About this world").</p>

<p>It is not enough to sort the array to pass the exercises. Your solution must
strictly follow the expected behavior of each exercise. This is enforced by
checking that your algorithm needs the same amount of read and write
operations to sort the array. </p>

<p>When your algorithm diverges from the expectation, understanding the
difference between your code and the expected solution can reveal very
difficult. To help in this process, it is posible to graphically explore the
history of your sorting algorithm. Switch to the Objective view and use the
contextual menu (right click)  to switch from the the view of the current
state to the view of its history.</p>

<p>A visão do histórico é um pouco bagunçada à primeira vista, mas na
verdade é bem simples: o tempo anda da esquerda para a direita neste
gráfico, e cada linha é uma célula de sua array. As linhas curvas que
navegam entre linhas representam um certo valor de um dado. Quando
duas linhas se cruzam, significa que dois valores foram trocados neste
momento; uma bifurcação numa linha representa uma cópia de valor;
quando um valor é magenta e seguido de uma interrogação (?), foi lido
usando getValor(); Se o valor é vermelho e seguido de uma exclamação
(!), foi escrito com setValor().</p> 

<h2>First attempt at BubbleSort</h2>

<p>This first sorting algorithm is the most simple one: Bubble sort consists in
progressively moving up the smaller elements of the array, as if they were
air bubbles moving up to the surface of a liquid. The algorithm traverse the
array, and compare any pair of adjacent elements. If two adjacent elements
are wrongly sorted, they are swapped. Once the array was completely
traversed, the operation starts again from the beginning. When no elements
were sorted after a full traversal, it means that the array is completely
sorted: the algorithm can stop.  Bubble sort is studied because of its
simplicity, but it is almost never used in practice because of its bad
performance (O(n^2) on average).</p>

<div class="tip" id="tip-1" alt="Show Tip (Pseudo-code)">
<p>The pseudo-code of the BubbleSort algorithm is the following:</p>
<pre>do: 
        For each i in [0,len-2]
          If cells i and i+1 must be swapped, do it
while we swapped something during last traversal
</pre>
