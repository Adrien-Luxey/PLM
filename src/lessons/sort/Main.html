<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

This lesson allows to experiment with some classical sorting algorithms (and
some less common variant of them). The goal is two fold: you can first
better understand the idea of these algorithms by writing them
yourself. But even if you don't code the algorithms, you can use the demo
mode to organize "races" between these algorithms to experiment in practice
what the different asymptotical complexity mean. 

<p>More exercises are planned for the future, on recursive sorting
algorithms (such as QuickSort and MergeSort) or using other
microworlds to apply these algorithms to other contexts.</p>
