<h1>PancakeWorld</h1>

<p>This universe is very simple, with only four functions provided.</p>

<pre class="Java">int getStackSize()</pre>
<pre class="python">getStackSize()</pre>

Returns the size of the stack, in other words the amount of pancakes it contains.

<pre class="Java">int getPancakeRadius(int rank)</pre>
<pre class="python">getPancakeRadius(rank)</pre>

Returns the radius of the pancake passed as argument, with the rank of the bottom pancake being 0.

<pre class="Java">boolean isPancakeUpsideDown(int rank)</pre>
<pre class="python">isPancakeUpsideDown(rank)</pre>

Returns whether the pancake passed as argument is upside-down, that is, if its burned side is on top.

<pre class="Java">void flip(int amount)</pre>
<pre class="python">flip(amount)</pre>

Flips the <code>amount</code> first pancakes composing the stack, from the top of it.

<pre class="Java">boolean isSorted()</pre>
<pre class="python">isSorted()</pre>

Returns whether the pancake stack is correctly sorted.

<h2>About this problem</h2>
<p>It is inspired by a problem first introduced in 1975 by Harry Dweighter in the American 
Mathematical Monthly. The question is not only to sort the pancakes, but to determine <code>f(n)</code>
the <i>minimal</i> amount of flips mandated to sort any stack of size <code>n</code>.</p> 

<p>This problem is now famous because Bill Gates authored (with C. Papadimitriou) his only 
scientific publication in 1979 on this topic, providing a faster algorithm and proving that <code>17n/16 ≤ f(n) ≤ (5n+5)/3</code>.
This was the only publication of Bill Gates before he invented Windows and became rich.</p>  
 
<p>Then, David X. Cohen, the inventor of the Futurama comics with many mathematical references, introduced 
the variant with burnt pancakes and studied its complexity with Manuel Blum in 1993.</p>

<p>An article of 2012 (by L. Bulteau, G. Fertin and I. Rusu) proved that determining the minimal amount of 
flips to sort the stack is a NP-complete problem. Naturally, the stack sorting problem is not NP-complete 
since it can be solved in 2n-3 steps with the naive algorithm and (5n+5)/3 steps with the Gates algorithm. 
That's determining the minimal amount of steps that is NP.</p>
