<h3>The pancake problem</h3>

<p>Help the poor psychorigid pancakes' chef to sort its pancake stack!</p>

<p>This funny problem leads to algorithms that are somewhat more
challenging to implement. You are supposed to master the bases of
programming to take this lesson. A previous exposure to the sorting
algorithms may also help.</p>
