<h3>LightBot</h3>

<p>This lesson constitutes a little brain teaser for programmers. You have to
instruct your robot to turn off all lights. The trick is that you program
your robot graphically, and that you are limited in the amount of
instructions.</p>

<p>No previous experience is expected to take this lesson.</p>
