<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to the lightbot world. This is merely a programmer game rather than a real lesson. You have to switch on every lights of the board using your little robot.

<p>The robot is not programmed in Java, but rather using a dedicated language. You can see the existing keywords in the documentation using the <i>About this world</i> menu.

<p>This is a introduction exercise, which should be solvable using only <code>forward</code> and <code>light</code>.
