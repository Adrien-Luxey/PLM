<h2>Turmites</h2>

<p>This exercise explores a new way to extend the concept of Langton's ant. Now, 
the behavior of the ant not only depends on the color on the ground, but also on 
its internal state (represented by an integer value). The idea of changing the 
ant into such an automata naturally comes from the Turing machine concept. This 
explains the name of these new animals, which is a portemanteau of <i>Turing</i> 
and <i>Termite</i> (if you don't know what a Turing machine is, you should run 
to wikipedia, because it is simply impossible to be a real computer scientist 
before that).</p>     

<p>Once again, you just have to write the <code>step()</code> method, in charge 
of doing one turmite's step. Once again, you should first find the rank of the 
current's cell ground color in the color sequence. But this time, the 
<code>rule</code> data depends both on the current color and the current state. 
<code>rule</code> actually contains 3 information in each situation: 
the color to write, the move to do, and the next state value. For 
example, rule[1][0] contains the informations to use when <code>state==1</code> and 
<code>color==0</code>. In other worlds, you can retrieve the information relative 
to your current situation by using <code>rule[state][currentColor]</code>.</p> 

<p>Each such information set contains 3 values. The first one is the rank of the 
color to write on the ground. The second is the move to do, with the following 
notation: 0=stop, 1=noturn, 2=right, 4=u-turn, 8=left. Note that if the command is stop, 
you shouldn't even move forward on that step (but you shouldn't stop your program 
either: the next steps can do something else in a future state). Finally, the third integer is the 
next <code>state</code> value to go into after this iteration.</p> 

<p class="Java">Since these arbitrary notations are somehow difficult to remember, the template 
code defines a set of constants that you should use instead of the direct numerical 
values. Their names are NOTURN, LEFT, RIGHT and so on. The modifiers <code>final 
static</code> before their type is the way to mark variables as constant in Java 
(sorry if the notation seems complex). Using such constants greatly help making the 
code easier to read. This allows to write things this way:</p> 
<p class="python">Since these arbitrary notations are somehow difficult to remember, the template 
code defines a set of constants that you should use instead of the direct numerical 
values. Their names are NOTURN, LEFT, RIGHT and so on. By convention, such constant variables 
are written in upper case in python. Technically, you can still modify them, but that would be 
a very bad idea. Using such constants greatly help making the 
code easier to read, as it allows to write things this way:</p> 
<pre class="Java">
  if (rule[state][currentColor][NEXT_MOVE] == LEFT) {
    turnLeft();
  }
</pre>
<pre class="python">
  if rule[state][currentColor][NEXT_MOVE] == LEFT:
    turnLeft()
</pre>
<p>This is much more easier to read than the following way:</p>
<pre class="Java">
  if (rule[x][y][1] == 2) {
    turnLeft();
  }
</pre>
<pre class="python">
  if rule[x][y][1] == 2:
    turnLeft()
</pre>
 
<p class="python">Finally, you probably want to write a <code>elif</code> branch for the 
<code>STOP</code> condition too. Having a <code>else</code> branch displaying an error 
message such as "unknown case" is a good practice: it makes your assumptions about your 
code more explicit, and you will get an error message if they fall short. When doing so, 
the next problem is that you have nothing to do in the <code>STOP</code> case, but python 
do not allows you to write empty <code>elif</code> branches. You should use the <code>pass</code> 
instruction as a placeholder: it says python that you have a branch here, and that it 
does not contain anything.</p>
 
<p>You now should have enough information to succeed.</p>

<h2>Bibliographical notes</h2>
<p>According to wikipedia, turmites were invented independently by the end of 
the eighties. It has been shown that turmites in general are exactly equivalent 
in power to one-dimensional Turing machines with an infinite tape, as either can 
simulate the other. This means that absolutely any program that you can think of 
could theoretically be computed on this device...</p>
