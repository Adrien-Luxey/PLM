<h1>[!java|scala]Arrays[/!][!python]Lists[/!] and Knotting</h1>

The goal of this exercise is to reproduce the pattern of the first row in
the other rows with a shift of one cell (see the Objective tab for
details). The biggest difference between this exercise and the others we had
on patterns is that you have to read the pattern (on first row) before
reproducing it. You cannot do otherwise because the same code will be
executed on three different worlds, each of them having its specific
pattern.

<p>One solution is to read the next cell, and go copy it in position before
coming back to read the second cell. But since it is forbidden to use the
methods to teleport the buggle to a specific position (<code>setPos()</code>
and similar), this approach will be a pain to implement. </p>
 
<p>The simplest is to store the sequence of colors that constitute 
the whole pattern in an [!java|scala]<b>array</b>[/!][!python]<b>list[/!]</b>.</p>

<h2>[!java|scala]Arrays[/!][!python]List[/!]</h2> 

<p>[!java|scala]An array[/!][!python]A list[/!] is an ordered sequence of variables.
It is somehow similar to a shelve where each level can store a separate value.

<p>
positions, each cell acting as a variable on its own.  in which one can store values of the
same kind (one value per cell). It is thus a sequence of values of the same
kind:</p>

<p class="python">A list is an array of positions in which one can store values. Each  
cell is a variable on its own. A list is then a sequence of values. Lists can even mix 
values of differing types, such as integer values in some cells and colors in other cells.
At the end, a list is very similar to a storage shelve, where each level can store a 
separate value.</p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="array.png"/></div>

<p class="Java">T is the array's name, T[0] is the name of the first cell, T[1] the name of
the second cell, T[2] the third one, etc. And yes, the first cell in
numbered T[0] and the last one of an array of size N is T[N-1].</p>
<p class="python">T is the list's name, T[0] is the name of the first cell, T[1] the name of
the second cell, T[2] the third one, etc. And yes, the first cell in
numbered T[0] and the last one of a list of size N is T[N-1]. It may seem funny to 
count starting from 0 and not from 1 as usual, but some historical reasons make it 
unavoidable here.</p>

<p>We can use an integer variable <i>i</i> to access with T[i] to the 
cells: when the value of <i>i</i> is 0, then T[i] accesses T[0], when the
value of <i>i</i> is 10, then T[i] accesses T[10]. <i>i</i> is said to be
the index in T.

<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>If <code>T</code> contains 10 elements, then each cell can be
initialized with a simple loop:</p>
<pre class="Java">
for (int i = 0; i&lt;10; i++) {
   T[i] = 3;
}
</pre>
<pre class="python">
for i in range(10):
   T[i] = 3;
</pre>

<p class="python">Note that <code>range(max)</code> returns the list of all 
integers that are smaller than <code>max</code>, starting with 0. There is exactly 
max such values. For example, if <code>max</code> is 3, the returned values are 
0, 1 and 2.</p>

<p><code>T[i]</code> can be used just like a variable. We can set a new value:</p> 
<pre>T[i] = 78</pre>

<p>We can retrieve and use its value: </p>
<pre>x = T[i]</pre>

<p>We can test this value:</p>
<pre class="Java">
if (T[i] > 0 ) {
    // instructions...
}
</pre>
<pre class="python">
if T[i] > 0:
    // instructions...
</pre>

<h3>Declaring an array</h3>
<p class="python">If you know beforehand the content of your list, you can affect these values all together. 
Just put them between square braces and separated by commas as follows:</p>
<pre class="python">
L = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] 
# L is now an array of 5 values, all of them being integers
</pre>
<p class="python">Otherwise, you probably want to create an empty list and then append each values separately:</p>
<pre class="python">
L2 = [] 
# L2 is now an empty list
L2.append(1)
L2.append(3)
L2.append(5)
L2.append(7)
L2.append(9) 
# Its content is now the same as L previously
</pre> 
 
<p class="Java">An array can be declared the following way:</p>
<pre class="Java">int[] T;</pre>

<p class="Java"><code>int</code> means that the elements of the array are of type integer;
<code>T</code> is the name of the array and <code>[]</code> means that we
are speaking of an array. It is also possible to declare the same array the
following way. Both writings are equivalent, but the first one is often
prefered in Java.</p>
<pre class="Java">int T[];</pre>

<h3 class="Java">Allocating an array</h3>

<p class="Java">Declaring a variable <code>T</code> that stores an array only reserve the name <code>T</code> for
later use. But the array is not initialized yet: it does not have any
value. What would <code>T[4]</code> mean if we didn't say that the array is
at least 5 cells long?</p>

<p class="Java">First and foremost, we have to give a value to <code>T</code>:</p>
<pre class="Java">T = new int[10];</pre>

<p class="Java"><code>new</code> means that we want to create something, and
<code>int[10]</code> means that it is an array of 10 integer values. In
return, an array of 10 integer cells is created in memory, and the
<code>T</code> variable reference this array.</p>

<p class="Java">The size of an array is fixed and cannot be changed after the creation of
the array. To know the size of a <code>T</code> array, we can consult the
value of the variable <code>T.length</code>.</p>

<p class="Java">
It is forbidden to write something like
<code>int T[10];</code>
You are required to use the <code>new</code> instruction. On the other hand,
you perfectly can specify the size with a variable <code>i</code>.
<pre class="Java">T = new int[i];</pre>
<p class="Java">In this case, the array's size will be set to the value of <code>i</code>
<b>when <code>new</code> gets called</b>. If the variable changes afterward,
it won't change the array's size.</p>

<h4 class="Java">Declaration and allocation</h4>
<pre class="Java">int[] T = new int[10];</pre>

<p class="Java">We declare and allocate the array on the same line.</p>

<h4 class="Java">Declaration and initialization</h4>
<pre class="Java">int[] T = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };</pre>

<p class="Java">We declare, allocate and initialize the array on the same line. To know the
size of the array to allocate, the compiler counts the provided values. This
code is equivalent to:
<pre class="Java">
int[] T = new int[10];
T[0] = 1;
T[1] = 2;
...
T[9] = 10;
</pre>

<p class="Java">It is also equivalent to:
<pre class="Java">
int[] T = new int[10];
for (int i=0; i&lt;T.length; i++) {
  T[i] = i+1;
}
</pre>





<h3 class="python">Lists and method parameters</h3>
<p class="python">It is perfectly ok to pass a list to a method as a parameter. This method
can then use this parameter as if it were defined there. Methods can also return lists as 
result without any complication. As an example, here is a method doubling every values of 
the list received as a parameter:
<pre class="python">
L = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
def doubling(param):
  for i in range( len(param) ):
    param[i] *= 2
</pre>


<h3 class="Java">Arrays and method parameters</h3>
<p class="Java">It is perfectly ok to pass an array to a method as a parameter. The method
must have a prototype similar to:</p>
<pre class="Java">void myMethod(int[] values) {
  // do something
}</pre>

<p class="Java">On the caller side, that also very simple:</p>
<pre class="Java">
int[] tab = new int[10];
// initalize the values
myMethod(tab);
</pre>

<p class="Java">We can also have methods returns arrays as results:</p>
<pre class="Java">int[] otherMethod() {
  int[] result = new int[10];
  // do something
  return result;
}</pre>

<h2>Goal of this exercise</h2>
<p class="python">Your code should save the color pattern observed on the first row into a list. 
The easiest is to create an empty list, and then <code>append()</code> the colors one after the others.</p>  


<p class="Java">The <code>run()</code> method that you should write must declare an array of
colors (<code>Color[]</code>) and allocate it. Beware, the first world is
6x6, but this is not the case of the others. Use the
<code>getWorldHeight()</code> method to retrieve the amount of lines in the
current world.</p>

<p class="Java">Once the array allocated, we have to fill it. For each cel of the row, read
the ground color (with <code>getGroundColor()</code>), and store it in the
right cell of the array.</p>

<p>Once you managed to read and save the pattern on the first row, you have to reapply the 
pattern on every rows, for example by executing <code>getWorldHeight()</code> times 
a method written specifically for this.</p> 

<p>You're up.</p>
