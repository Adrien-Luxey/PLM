<h2>Escrevendo programas mais complexos</h2>
  Agora que n√≥s sabemos como desenhar coisas no tabuleiro, vamos aproveitar
esta habilidade e desenhar um belo G (Veja o painel de Objetivo para
detalhes). 

  <p>When you write a quite complex program, it is sometimes useful to <b>add
comments</b> to simplify the code reviews afterward. Here for example, it's
quite easy to get lost in the drawing process, and you may want to add
comments like <i>vertical bar done</i> or <i>finished drawing the G. Time to
move back to initial position</i>. Commenting your code is almost mandatory
if you (or someone else) want to read it afterward, although over-commenting
(describing obvious stuff) is a bad idea as the important idea get lost in
the noise.</p>
   
  <p>There is [!java]three[/!][!python|scala]two[/!] types of comments in
[!thelang], instructing the
[!java|scala]compiler[/!][!python]interpreter[/!] to not read the text you
add for humans:</p>
   
  <ul>
    <li><b>Comments on a single line</b>. When the
[!java|scala]compiler[/!][!python]interpreter[/!] encounters the symbol
[!java|scala]//[/!][!python]#[/!], it ignores the end of the line.</li>      
    <li><b>Comments on several lines</b>. The
[!java|scala]compiler[/!][!python]interpreter[/!] ignores anything placed
between [!java|scala]the symbols /* and */ even if they are placed on
differing lines.[/!] [!python]a line beginning with ''' and the next line
ending with '''.[/!]</li>
  </ul>

[!python]<span class="comment">''' This is</span>

  <p class="Java">There is a third kind of comments in Java, between /** and */, which are
read by a specific program called JavaDoc to generate automatically the
documentation explaining how to use the code. These comments must follow a
very precise formalism.</p>

  <p class="Python">The comments on several lines are often used to document how to use the
code, while others are more used to describe how this code works.</p>
