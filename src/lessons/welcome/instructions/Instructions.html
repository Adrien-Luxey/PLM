<h2>Instructions</h2>

Congratulations! You just wrote your first program! You got the idea now: 
programming is nothing more than giving simple instructions to the computer that 
blindly apply them. The main difficulty is to explain stuff to something as stupid 
as a computer...  
  
  <p>Programs are mainly suites of method calls, which are no more than a list of
   simple order given to the machine. It is very similar to a recipe stating
   <i>Melt the chocolate pieces, add sugar, cool the mix and serve</i>. 
   In your programs, such built instructions are called functions or methods, and you 
   should add parenthesis to invoke them:</p>  
		<pre>nameOfTheMethod()</pre>
		
   <p>[!thelang] wants to have the instructions separated by semi-columns 
    (;)[!python|scala] or by new lines[/!].
    The previous example would thus be written in the following 
    way[!python|scala] (you can also add semi-columns at the end of the lines, but this is not mandatory)[/!].</p>
    
<pre>
meltTheChocolatePieces()[!java];[/!]
addSugar()[!java];[/!]
coolMix()[!java];[/!]
serve()[!java];[/!]
</pre>
    
[!python|scala]
   <p>It could also be written in the following way, but it's generally considered as a bad 
   practice to group several instructions on the same line since it greatly hinders the 
   readability.</p>
<pre>
meltTheChocolatePieces(); addSugar(); coolMix(); serve()
</pre>
[/!]

  <p>Of course, these specific methods do not exist by default in [!java]Java[/!][!scala]Scala[/!][!python]Python[/!], 
  but it may be possible 
  to define them by yourself (we'll see later how to define your how methods).</p>
  
  <p>For now, 
  we'll simply go for the buggle instructions. There is a method for each button of the 
  interactive control panel. To achieve the same effect than the <b>forward</b> button 
  (making the buggle moving one step forward), you need to write the following in the
  editor: </p>
  <pre>forward()[!java];[/!]</pre>
  <p>Likewise, to achieve the same effect than the <b>backward</b>, <b>left</b>
  and <b>right</b> buttons, you need to use respectively:</p>
<pre>
backward()[!java];[/!]
left()[!java];[/!]
right()[!java];[/!]
</pre>

	 <p>The <b>mark</b> button is a bit particular, since it correspond to two
methods: the first one moves the pen up while the second moves it down.</p>
<pre>
brushUp()[!java];[/!]
brushDown()[!java];[/!]
</pre>
  <p>The buggle offers other methods, that are presented from the "Help/about
   this world" menu and will be introduced on need.</p>


  <h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives"/>
  Our second program will be a bit more complicated, but not much. The goal for 
  your buggle is simply to draw a house (a box), and hide inside. Check the 
  objective world to see exactly what this means. 

<p>When switching to the next exercise, please note that there is a sub-exercise following this one. 
By default, it is hidden in the menu and you have to open the sub-menu to see it. 
When you switch the exercise, most of the exercises are hidden because the tree is folded, as follows:</p>

<p>You have to click on the little symbol to the left of the buggle to unfold the tree, as follows:</p>
