<p>The goal of this serie of exercises is to let the buggle traverse its
world. It must number the cells it walks on to show its traversal order.</p>

<p>The main loop of your code should be something like:</p>
<pre>
 while we are not on the final position
   go to the next position
   label the cell with its number
</pre>

<p>Ao contrário dos exercícios que vimos até agora, não vamos usar os
 métodos <code>avançar()</code>, <code>recuar()</code> e similares. Ao
 invés disto, vamos, vamos calcular as coordenadas da próxima posição
 de buggle e usar o método <code>setPos(x, y)</code> para
 <i>teletransportar</i> o buggle diretamente para esta posição. Por
 exemplo, <code>setPos(3, 5)</code> teletransporta o buggle para a
 célula onde x=3 e y=5.</p>

<p>Your first task is thus to write a boolean function indicating whether the
buggle reached the final position or not, ie if it reached the bottom right
corner of the world. For this, you can use <code>getWorldWidth()</code> and
<code>getWorldHeight()</code> which return respectively the world's width
and height. Your test is about comparing the buggle's current position (that
you can access with <code>getX()</code> and <code>getY()</code>) to the
world dimensions.<br/>
Beware, the first line and column are numbered 0 and not 1...</p>  

<p>Then, you have to write the code to reach the next position. In this
exercise, you have to traverse the world row after row. So, if you are at
the bottom of a row, you have to move to the top of next row, and you have
to move to the cell below else.</p>

<p>At this point, you can launch your program to check that the buggle
correctly traverse the world in the expected order, and that it stops when
it has to. Use the <b>stop</b> button if the buggle does not stop correctly.</p>

<p>It is now time to write down the cell numbers. For that, you will need a
counter initialiser to zero at the beginning of your code, and incremented
by one at each step (for example with <code>counter += 1;</code>).  Then,
you have to use <code>writeMessage()</code> to write the value on the
ground.
</p>

<p>You probably need to write the first [!java|scala|c]or last [/!]value out of
the main loop [!java|scala|c], depending on whether you prefer to use a
<code>while</code> or a <code>do/while</code> one[/!].</p>
