<h2>Variables</h2>

We saw in a previous exercise that variables are memory cells of the
computer in which it is possible to store a value. In Java, every variable
has a particular type, such as <code>int</code> to store integers,
<code>boolean</code> for booleans, <code>double</code> for dot numbers or
<code>String</code> for char strings.

<p>The syntax to create an integer variable <code>x</code> with 4 as initial
value is the following: 
<pre>int x = 4;</pre>
<p>Another example with char strings:
<pre>String hello = "what's up, doc?";</pre>

<p>To change the value in a variable, you just have to use the = symbol: <pre>x = 3;</pre>

<p>To the right of the equal symbol, you can put an arbitrary arithmetic
operation, which can contain constants or variables:

<pre>x = 3 + 2;
x = 3 * x;
hello = "hello "+"every"+"body!";
</pre> 

<h3>Baggles</h3> 

The buggle world can sometimes contain some <i>baggles</i>, which are little
biscuits that buggles can carry from one point to another. For that, they
have to use the following methods:

<pre>isOverBaggle() <span class="comment">/* boolean test to know whether the buggle is currently over a baggle */</span>
isCarryingBaggle() <span class="comment">/* boolean test to know whether the buggle is currently carrying a baggle */</span>
pickUpBaggle() <span class="comment">/* pickup the baggle laying on the ground (if there is no baggle on the ground, this will lead to a problem) */</span>
dropBaggle() <span class="comment">/* drop the baggle carried (there is a problem if the buggle does not carry any baggle, 
                or if there is already a baggle on the ground) */</span></pre>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectifs"> It is now time to do more challenging exercises, don't
you think? The objective is now to move forward until you find a baggle,
pick it up, and then move back to your initial location before dropping the
baggle.

<h3>Indications</h3><a name="Indications"> 
<p>To solve this problemm, you have to decompose it in easier sub-parts. For
example, you may want to do the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Move forward until located over a baggle</li>
  <li>Pickup the baggle</li>
  <li>Move backward of the same amount of steps than done in first step</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Naturally, it is impossible to do the right amount of steps backward at step
3 if you didn't count the amount of steps done in the first phase. You can
use a variable for that, which can be named <code>stepAmount</code>.</p>

<p>Create a variable (of type <code>int</code>) before phase 1, initialize it
to 0, and each time you move one step forward, increment its value by one
(<code>stepAmount = stepAmount + 1;</code> or <code>stepAmount++;</code>,
both syntaxes being equivalent).</p>

<p>Then, phase 3 consists in simply creating a new integer variable
<code>doneSteps</code> initialized to 0, and do one step backward until
<code>doneSteps</code> equals <code>stepAmount</code>, incrementing
<code>doneSteps</code> each time.</p>

<p>Please note that it is forbiden to use spaces in variable names in Java. So
you can name you variable <code>stepAmount</code>, but <code>step
Amount</code> is not a valid name.</p>

<p>It's your turn now!</p>
