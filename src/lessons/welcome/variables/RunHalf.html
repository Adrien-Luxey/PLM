<h2>The Four Halves run</h2>

<p>Here is the second day of the Big Buggles' Race.  
As previously, you have to run forward until you reach the right cell to stop on. 
But this time, you have to reach the cell where you saw as much baggles as orange cells plus 1. 
In other word, the following condition must become true <code>2 * baggles = orangeCells + 1</code>.</p>

<p>You can determine whether you are over a yellow cell with the <code>isOverOrange()</code> method.</p>
