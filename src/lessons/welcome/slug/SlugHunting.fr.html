<h2>Chasse à la limace</h2>

<p>Now that your <code>isFacingTrail()</code> method is working, it's time to
write the code to organize the hunting party. Copy/paste your code from the
previous exercise, and complete the <code>hunt()</code> method.</p>

<p>Following a track is not very difficult: move forward as long as you have
the track in front of you.  If there is not track in front of you anymore,
check if the rest of the track is on your left or on your right, and follow
it further.</p>

<p>To ensure that you don't mix the track you come from with the one in front
of you, the easier is to erase the track when you follow it. Use the method
<code>brushDown()</code> to put your brush down and mark the ground, and
<code>brushUp()</code> to move it up again.</p>

<p>Enfin, n'oubliez de capturer votre proie une fois que vous l'aurez débusquée
(avec <code>pickUpBaggle()</code>).</p>


<h3>Objectif de cet exercice</h3>
<a name="Objectives"> Complete the <code>hunt()</code> method. You probably
want to copy over the <code>isFacingTrail()</code> method that you wrote in
previous exercise.  </a>
