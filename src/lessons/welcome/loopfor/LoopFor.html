<h2>For loops</h2>

<p>While loops are well adapted to situations where you want to achieve an
action while a condition stays true, but it is less adapted to achieve a
given action a predetermined amount of time. For example, when we wanted to
move <code>stepAmount</code> steps backward in a previous exercise, we had to
create a new variable, initialize it, and move backward while incrementing 
this variable until it became equal to <code>stepAmount</code>.</p> 

<p>In such situations, <code>for</code> loops become handy. Their syntax is the
following:</p> 
<pre>[!java]for (<b>initializing</b>; <b>condition</b>; <b>incrementing</b>) {
    <b>action</b>();
}[/!][!python]for <b>variable</b> in <b>sequence of values</b>:
    <b>action</b>()[/!][!scala] for (<b>variable</b> &lt;- <b>firstValue</b> to <b>lastValue</b>) { 
    <b>action</b>();
}[/!]</pre>

<p>For example to repeat the the loop body <code>n</code> times, 
[!python] it is handy to use the instruction <code>range(n)</code> to generate the sequence n integer value from 0 to n-1.[/!]
[!java|scala] one should write:[/!]</p>
<pre>[!java]for (int stepper=0; stepper&lt;n; stepper++) {
    <b>action</b>();
}[/!][!python]for <b>stepper</b> in <b>range(n)</b>:
    <b>action</b>()[/!][!scala] for (var <b>stepper</b> &lt;- <b>0</b> to <b>10</b>) { 
    <b>action</b>();
}[/!]</pre>

<p>This code is then perfectly equivalent to the following one.</p>
<pre>[!java]int stepper = 0;
while (stepper < 10) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>action</b>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>stepper++</b>;
}[/!][!python]stepper=0
while stepper<10: 
    action()
    stepper = stepper + 1[/!][!scala]
var stepper = 0
while (stepper<10) {
    <b>action</b>()
    stepper = stepper + 1
}[/!]</pre>

<p>The <code>for</code> loop is easier to read, don't you think?</p>

[!java]
<p>It is possible to build more advanced <tt>for</tt> loops since any valid
instruction can be used as initialization, condition and incrementation. The
following example is a bit extreme there is no need for a loop body to move 
the buggle forward until it reaches the wall, but it works well: all the work is 
done in the condition and incrementation.

<pre>for (; !isFacingWall() ; forward()) { 
   <span class="comment">/* nothing in the loop body */</span>
}
<span class="comment">/* the buggle now faces a wall */</span></pre>
[/!]

<h3>Exercise goal</h3>
<p> You now have to redo the same exercise than previously
(move forward until being over a baggle, pick it up, move back to your
original location, drop the baggle), but using a <code>for</code> loop instead
of a <code>while</code> loop to move back to the initial location.</p

<p>Once done, you can proceed to next exercise.</p>
