  <h2>Java Instructions</h2>

  Congratulations! You just wrote your first program! You got the idea now: 
  programming is nothing more than giving simple instructions to the computer that 
  blindly apply them. The main difficulty is to explain stuff to someone as stupid 
  as a computer...  
  
  <p>Programs are mainly suites of method calls, which are no more than a list of
   simple order given to the machine. It is very similar to a recipe stating
   <i>Melt the chocolate pieces, add sugar, cool the mix and serve</i>. Java want 
   to have the instructions separated by semi-columns (;) and given parenthesis, as in
		<pre>nameOfTheMethod()</pre>
  <p>The example of previous recipe would thus be written in a similar way:
<pre>
meltTheChocolatePieces();
addSugar();
coolMix();
serve();
</pre>

  <p>Of course, these specific methods do not exist in Java, but it may be possible 
  to define them by yourself (we'll see later how to define your how methods). For now, 
  we'll simply go for the buggle instructions. There is a method for each button of the 
  interactive control panel. To achieve the same effect than the <b>forward</b> button 
  (making the buggle moving one step forward), you need to write the following in the
  editor: <pre>forward();</pre>
  Likewise, to achieve the same effect than the <b>backward</b>, <b>turn
  left</b> and <b>turn right</b> buttons, you need to use respectively: 
<pre>
backward();
turnLeft();
turnRight();
</pre>
	 The <b>mark</b> button is a bit particular, since it correspond to two
methods: the first one moves the pen up while the second moves it down.
<pre>
brushDown();
brushUp();
</pre></p>
  <p>The buggle offers other methods, that are presented from the "Help/about
   this world" menu and will be introduced on need.</p>


  <h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives">
  Our second program will be a bit more complicated, but not much. The goal for 
  your buggle is simply to draw a house (a box), and hide inside. Check the 
  objective world to see exactly what this means.
