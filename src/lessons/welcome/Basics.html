  <h2>Discovering Java</h2>

  We will now write our first Java program. In a computer program (let it be
in Java or anything else), you can find two kind of stuff: <b>data</b> and
<b>instructions</b> manipulating these data.

  <h3>Data in Java</h3>
  Java allows to use several <i>types</i> of data, such as integers or strings
of chars. If you want to use a data several times, you need to store it
within a <i>variable</i>, which can be seen as a cell containing a
value. Java is said to be a <i>typed</i> language, which means that it is
onle possible to store a value in a variable of the right type. Don't think
about storing a string into an integer variable.
  
  <p>To <i>declare</i> (ie, create) a variable, you just need to write its type,
a space, and the variable name. From the existing types, we can speak of
<b>int</b> (for integers), <b>double</b> for dot numbers, <b>boolean</b> for
booleans (ie, values being either true or false) and <b>String</b> for char
strings. If you want, you can specify the initial value of the variable by
adding a equal sign (=) followed by the value after the declaration. </p>
  <p>So, to create a variable named <b>x</b> intended to contain integers, one
can write: <pre>int x;</pre>
	 If you want that the variable contains 5 as initial value, you should type: <pre>int x = 5;</pre>
  <p>Later in the program, if you want to <i>affect</i> a new value to the
variable, that's really easy:
        
		<pre>x=3; <span class="comment">It replace the old value of x by 3</span></pre>

  <h3>Generality on instructions</h3><a name="generality">The simplest Java program is constituted by a suite of
instructions separated by semi-columns (;). You can read it as a list of
simple order given to the machine. It is very similar to a recipe stating
<i>Melt the chocolate pieces, add sugar, cool the mix and serve</i>.
  <p>Variable affectations such as <pre>x=5</pre> are the simpler instructions. The other instruction kind in Java are
constituted by <i>method calls</i>. We will come back later on how to define
such methods, but we can already say that they are the available orders. The
general syntax is:
		<pre>nameOfTheMethod()</pre>
  <p>The example of previous recipe would thus be written in a similar way:
<pre>
meltTheChocolatePieces();
addSugar();
coolMix();
serve();
</pre>

  <h3>Java instructions</h3><a name="instructions">Of course, these methods do not exist in Java, and it
is almost impossible to list all existing methods in Java. In this lesson,
the most common instructions are calls to the buggle methods, ie, orders
passed to the buggle.
  <p>For example, there is a method for each button of the interactive control
panel. To achieve the same effect than the <b>forward</b> button (making the
buggle moving one step forward), you need to write the following in the
editor: <pre>forward();</pre>
	 Likewise, to achieve the same effect than the <b>backward</b>, <b>turn
left</b> and <b>turn right</b> buttons, you need to use respectively: 
<pre>
backward();
turnLeft();
turnRight();
</pre>
	 The <b>mark</b> button is a bit particular, since it correspond to two
methods: the first one moves the pen up while the second moves it down.
<pre>
brushDown();
brushUp();
</pre></p>
  <p>The buggle offers other methods, that we will introduce when needed.</p>

  <h3>Adding comments</h3>
  When you write a quite complex program, it is sometimes useful to add
<i>comments</i> to simplify the code reviews afterward. There is three types
of comments in Java:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Comments on a single line</b>. When the compiler encounters the symbol
//, it ignores the end of the line.</li>
	<li><b>Comments on several lines</b>. The compiler ignores anything placed
between the symbols /* and */, even if they are placed on differing lines.</li>
  </ul>
<pre>
methodCallReadByTheCompiler(); <span class="comment"> // all this is ignored</span>
otherCall(); <span class="comment">/* This is</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment"> also ignored */</span>
yetAnotherCall();
</pre>  
  
  <p>There is a third kind of comments, between /** and */, which are read by a
specific program called JavaDoc to generate automatically the documentation
explaning how to use the code. These comments must follow a very precise
formalism.</p>

  <h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives">We will now write the simplest Java program for buggles
ever: you need to ask your buggle to move one step forward.
  <p>For that, simply write the following code in the editor (tab <b>Source
Code</b>): <pre>forward();</pre>
     Do not forget the final semi-colum, which tells the compiler that the
instruction is over.</p>
  <p>After typing this code into the editor, clic on <b>run</b> and move forward
to next exercise.</p>
