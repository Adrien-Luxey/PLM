<h2>Caça à lesma</h2>

<p>Now that your <code>isFacingTrail()</code> method is working, it's time to
write the code to organize the hunting party. Copy/paste your code from the
previous exercise, and complete the <code>hunt()</code> method.</p>

<p>Following a track is not very difficult: move forward as long as you have
the track in front of you.  If there is not track in front of you anymore,
check whether the rest of the track is on your left or on your right, and
follow it further.</p>

<p>Para garantir que você não misture o caminho de onde você veio com o
para onde você vai, a forma mais fácil é apagar o caminho por onde
você passa. Use o método <code>abaixarPincel()</code> para abaixar seu
pincel e marcar o chão, e <code>levantarPincel()</code> para
levantá-lo de novo.</p>

<p>Finally, do not forget to capture your prey once you found it (using
<code>pickupBaggle()</code>).</p>


<h3>Objetivo do exercício</h3>
<a name="Objectives"> Complete the <code>hunt()</code> method. You probably
want to copy over the <code>isFacingTrail()</code> method that you wrote in
previous exercise.  </a>
