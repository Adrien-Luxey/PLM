<h2>Conditional instructions</h2>

Programs made of simple suite of instructions similar to previous exercise
are quite boring. They always do the same thing, and cannot react to
external conditions. A <b>conditional</b> let the program adapt by doing
something like <i>if it's raining, take an umbrella</i>. 

<p>The Java syntax is the following:
 <pre>if (<b>condition</b>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>whatToDo();</b>
}</pre>
If the condition is true, any code enclosed between the { and the
corresponding } will be executed. If not, it will be ignored. Of course, it
is possible to write more than one instruction between the curly brackets
(even another test).</p>

<p>A condition can be a variable of type <tt>boolean</tt>. The code between
curly braces will get executed if the variable is <tt>true</tt> and it will
be ignored if it is <tt>false</tt>.</p>

<p>The condition can also be an arithmetic test, such as <tt>x</tt> <b>==</b>
<tt>5</tt>, which checks whether the current value of <tt>x</tt> is 5, or
such as <b>!=</b> (checking inequality), <b>&lt;</b> (smaller than),
<b>&gt;</b> (larger than), <b>&lt;=</b> (smaller or equal to), <b>&gt;=</b>
(larger or equal to).</p>

<p>Beware of the classical trap, which consists in testing the equality of a
variable using = instead of ==. Hopefully, the Java compiler detects this
problem most of the time, but not always. If the variable is of type
boolean, it can get trapped, so you have to be careful...

<p>The condition can also be a call to some perticular methods returning a
boolean. For example, the <tt>isFacingWall()</tt> method of the buggle
returns true if the buggle is facing a wall, and false in the other case.

<p>Finally, a condition can be composed of several sub-conditions connected by
boolean operations.
<ul>
  <li><tt>cond1 && cond2</tt> is true when <tt>cond1</tt> <b>and</b>
<tt>cond2</tt> are both true.</li>
  <li><tt>cond1 || cond2</tt> is true if <tt>cond1</tt> <b>or</b> <tt>cond2</tt>
are true (if <tt>cond1</tt> is true, <tt>cond2</tt> is not even evaluated).</li>
  <li><tt>!cond</tt> is true if <tt>cond</tt> is false.</li>
  <li>It is possible to force the order of evaluation by adding parenthesis. In
ambigous cases, do not hesitate to add more parenthesis to remove any
ambiguities on evaluation order.</li>
</ul> 

<p>At least, it is possible to specify what to do when the condition is false
using the following syntax:
 <pre>if (<b>condition</b>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>whatToDoIfTheConditionIsTrue();</b>
} else {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>whatToDoIfItsFalse();</b>
}</pre>


<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives">If the buggle is facing a wall (predicate
<tt>isFacingWall()</tt>), you must move one step back. If not, you must move
one step forward.

<p>This exercise is a bit different: your code has to work for several buggles,
each of them being in a specific initial condition. The same code will be
executed for each of them.</p>

<p>When your program works, move forward to the next exercise.</p>
