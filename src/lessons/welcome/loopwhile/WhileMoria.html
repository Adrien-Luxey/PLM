<h2>Lost in the Moria</h2>
		
<p>You buggle got stuck in a mine! Some rocks are blocking the exit, 
and you will have to clear your way to the exit. Well of course these 
are only baggles and you could simply walk away, but it will be easier 
to program your buggle so that it moves those "rocks" than convincing your buggle 
that it could easily walk away without solving the problem...</p>
   
<p>So, you have to find the first baggle blocking the exit (simply walk 
to the east until you are over a baggle), take it and move it back to the 
other side of the tunnel (walk to the west while you are not over a baggle, 
and then move back one step to the east and drop your baggle), and iterate 
until you find the exit (that is, the wall to the east side). Afterward, 
move out as in the objective world.</p>
    
<p>Once you manage to escape this trap, you can move forward to the next exercise.
This exercise is a bit more complex, so you can also leave it for now and come 
back later if you don't get it right now.</p>
