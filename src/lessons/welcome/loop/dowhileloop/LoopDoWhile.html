<h2>Do .. while loops</h2>

<p class="Python">Here is another little exercise about loops. It is slightly more complex as we want the action 
to be executed in any case, even if the condition is false right away. Some languages have specific 
constructs for that, but not the Python language. No problem, I'm sure you can do it without them, can't you?</p>

<p class="Python">A bad solution would be to duplicate the loop content before the loop, but code duplication 
is a <b>very</b> bad habit, and you should always avoid it. A better solution is to have a dedicated variable 
indicating whether we are taking the loop for the first time, as follows:</p>
<pre class="Python">firstTime = True
while firstTime or (other conditions):
  firstTime = False
  (loop body)
</pre>

<p class="Java">In a <tt>while</tt> loop, the condition is evaluated before anything else,
and if it's false, the loop body is never evaluated. Sometimes (although not 
that often), you would prefer the
loop body to get evaluated at least once, even if the condition is initially
false. For that, a variation of the <tt>while</tt> loop gets used, using the
following syntax in Java:
<pre class="Java">do {
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>action()</b>;
} while (<b>condition</b>);</pre></p>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives"> Some cells of the world are yellow, but your buggle
cannot stand being in such cells. Write the necessary code to move forward until the ground 
gets white. For that, use the provided method <code>isGroundWhite()</code>.</p>

<p>The trick is that most buggles of this world are currently on this yellow ground 
that they dislike so much. That is why they are in panic, and every buggle rushes 
one cell forward, even the buggle that was not on a yellow cell at first. In other worlds,  
even if the ground is white on the first cell, you still want to move forward to the next cell.</p>    

<p>The general idea is to do something like: 
<pre>move forward until located in a white cell</pre>

<p class="Java"><i>Remark:</i> it is also possible to solve this exercise with a classical
<tt>while</tt> loop, but it's not the goal.</p>
