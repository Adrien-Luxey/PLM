<h2>The crazy mouse</h2>

<p>The day of your buggle starts badly. Out of luck, it got trapped into a
maze. Help it finding its path out of there. 
</p>

<p>
The exit is represented by a baggle and you need to 
pick this baggle in order to exit the maze.
</p>

<p>
Since the maze is so small, we can write the dumbest possible algorithm to
do so. It relies on randomness and proves quite inefficient.
</p>

<p>
While the buggle didn't find the path to the escape, it must proceed the
following way: pick a random integer between 0 and 2 by using the
provided <code>random3()</code> method 
and make one of the following actions: moving forward if possible, turn left or turn right. 
</p>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives">

<p>
This exercise's objective is to write an algorithm
allowing the buggle to find its path out of the maze. 
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to pick up the baggle once you've reached it.
</p>
