<h2>Following the walls</h2>

<p>This time, the maze is a bit more complicated. Random won't be enough, we
ough to be smart!</p>

<p>Hopefully, this maze is simpler that it seems at the first glance: there is
not island where our buggle could loop around for ever. To get out of this
kind of maze, the buggle only have to follow a wall (the one on its left or
the one on its right). While keeping the paw on the wall, the buggle must
move forward until it finds the maze exit and this biscuit it loves so much.</p>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3>The goal of this exercise is to write an algorithm allowing the buggle to
get out of this maze.

<p>Before writing your program, pick a side (left or right). Your buggle will
follow the buggles on this side.
</p>
<p>Write a method <code>void putHandOnSideWall()</code> which moves your buggle
so that it goes to the wall on the selected side. Do not forget to change
the buggle heading so that it does not face the wall anymore at the method
end.
</p>
<p>
Write a method <code>void keepHandOnSideWall()</code> which lets the buggle
move one step forward while keeping the paw on the wall on the selected
side. You thus have to ensure that the buggle always keep the paw on the
wall, but also that it won't crash into a wall.
</p>
<p>
Finaly, write a <code>run()</code> method which looks for the closer wall
(using <code>void putHandOnSideWall()</code>) and then traverse the maze
(using  <code>void keepHandOnSideWall()</code>) until it finds the biscuit
and the exit. Don't forget to pick the baggle up.
</p>
<p>You're up.</p>
