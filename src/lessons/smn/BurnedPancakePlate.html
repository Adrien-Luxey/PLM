<h1>PancakeWolrd</h1>

This world implements the control freak pancake seller problem, who wants his pancakes to be sorted on their plate from the biggest to the smallest, with the most burned face downside, so that we cannot see it.

You are asked to resort a pancakes stack to make him happy. Since it is obviously forbidden to place a pancake on the dirty table, the only allowed action is to flip one or more pancakes on the top of the stack.
A pancake is defined by its size and position on the stack, from the top to the bottom. These characteristics are strictly positive integers.

Only four functions are provided :

<pre>int getStackSize()</pre>

Returns the size of the stack, in other words the amount of pancakes it contains.

<pre>int getPancakeSize(int pancakeNumber)</pre>

Returns the size of the pancake you gave in argument.

<pre>boolean isPancakeUpsideDown(int pancakeNumber)</pre>

Returns true if the burned side of the pancake you gave in argument is up, false if not.

<pre>void flip(int numberOfPancakes)</pre>

Flips the <code>numberOfPancakes</code> first pancakes composing the stack, from the top of it.
