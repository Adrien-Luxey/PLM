<h1>Baseball</h1>

This world implements the baseball game, in which several players want to go back to their bases. The bases make a circle and have their own colors. There are two players for one base, except one, which has only one player in its team.

You are asked to make the players go on the bases which colors correspond to theirs. The only allowed move is for one of the two players standing on one of the two bases which are directly next to the base with only one player to move and fill the hole, leaving a new one on the base it just left.

There are seven functions provided :

<pre>void move(int baseSrc, int playerSrc)</pre>

Move the player on position <code>playerLocation</code> from the base <code>baseSrc</code> to the hole.

<pre> int getPlayerColor(int baseIndex, int playerLocation) </pre>

Return the color of the player on position <code>playerLocation</code> ( 0 or 1 ) from the base <code>baseIndex</code>.

<pre> int getBaseColor(int baseIndex) </pre>

Return the color of the base <code>baseIndex</code>.

<pre>int[] getHolePosition()</pre>

Return an integer array where the first element is the index of the base with the hole, and where the second element is the hole position within this base

<pre> boolean isBaseSorted( int baseIndex)</pre>

Return TRUE if all players of the base <code>baseSrc</code> are home  

<pre>int getAmountOfBases()</pre>

Return the amount of bases in the field.

<pre> int indexOfBaseWithOnePlayer() </pre>

Return the index of the base which has only one player on the field
