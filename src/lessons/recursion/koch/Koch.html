<h2>Snow flake</h2>

We will now draw snow flakes using the Koch fractal. A fractal is a
geometric pattern repeated at every scale.

<p>The general form is a triangle, with each side given by several recursive
calls. Your work is only to write the code of the <code>snowSide</code> method so 
that it draws one side of the triangle. To make it easier, each sides are represented 
in a specific color. Just draw the red things (without changing your pen color), 
and the other colors will be drawn automatically. </p>

<p>Observe the drawing in each world's objective to understand the pattern's
logic, and then reproduce it. You must write the <code>snowSide()</code>
method, which is recursive but <b>do not call snowFlake from snowSide</b>, 
or you will get very strange unexpected behaviors.</p>
