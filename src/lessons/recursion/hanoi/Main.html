<h1>Hanoi towers</h1>
<p>Here comes the super classical exercise on recursion along with
some variations. If you have any other nice variations, please submit them. 
At some point, someone should also probably contribute these variations to
wikipedia, as only the base problem is nicely described there.</p>

<p>The Interleaved and Split variations come from the following
article: "Exploring Recursion with Variations on the Towers of Hanoi", 
Daniel W. Palmer. Available at
http://www.ccscjournal.willmitchell.info/Vol12-96/No2a/Daniel%20W%20Palmer.pdf</p>

<p>The Linear Hanoi is briefly discussed in the article presenting the Linear Twin
Towers of Hanoi: "The Linear Twin Towers of Hanoi Problem", Steven Minsker. This 
article can only be accessed through the paywall of the editor, sorry.</p>
