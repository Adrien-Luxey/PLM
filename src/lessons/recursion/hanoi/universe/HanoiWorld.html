<h1>HanoiWorld</h1>

<p>
This world implements the ultra-classical Hanoi problem. You are asked
to move the disk pile from the stick where they are to the target
stick (given as second parameter in the world's name -- number 1 for
the default world). There is some extra constraint: you can only move
one disk at a time, and you cannot move a big disk over a smaller
one.</p>

<p>Only 3 functions are provided:</p>

<pre class="Java">void move(int src, int dst)</pre>
<pre class="python">move(src, dst) throws HanoiInvalidMove</pre>

Moves one disk from the stick <code>src</code> onto the stick
<code>dst</code>. If you try to do an invalid move (like laying a disk
over a smaller one), an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. 

<pre class="Java">int getSlotSize(int slot);</pre>
<pre class="python">getSlotSize(slot)</pre>
Returns the amount of disks placed on the specified slot. This is mainly 
used to initialize the recursion and set the amount of recursive call to execute.

<pre class="Java">boolean isSelected()</pre>
<pre class="python">isSelected()</pre>
Returns whether the current world is selected in the graphical interface.
